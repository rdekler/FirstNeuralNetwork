# FirstNeuralNetwork
My first attempt at a basic neural network.

I designed this with the task of identifying handwritten numbers from the MNIST data set in mind.

It is a basic, three-layer neural network with one layer for input, one for hidden processing, and one for outputs. It performs backpropogation for errors and uses a basic logarithmic function for the activation threshold.
